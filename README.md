Homie is a mobile application developed using React Native, inspired by platforms like Zillow. The app allows users to explore available apartments for rent and sale through an interactive map interface. This project provided me with valuable experience in mobile app development, particularly in working with React Native for building cross-platform applications. I learned how to implement features like real-time data updates, map integrations, and user-friendly interfaces. This project also enhanced my understanding of mobile app lifecycle management, API integration, and deploying apps on iOS and Android.
